Hi, I'm using Netguard for a year long and appreciate it very much.
But...
I tried to delete the list of access tries for an application ...it doesn't work.
I would like also to block several of all attemps...it takes many time to block them one per one...
Thanks à lot for your job..I don't know what I could do without
